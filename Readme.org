#+TITLE: Musical Pairs

* Progress

** Pomodoro 1

I bootstrapped with yeoman and beginning to work on the first part -
that is getting some squares to appear on the screen. I forgot a lot
of what I learnt about crafty last time so this feels slow
going. Maybe I will warm up.

Identified a few admin tasks like doing an 'im in' post and also
putting on a license. I don't feel like doing these just yet.
