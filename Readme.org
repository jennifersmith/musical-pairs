#+TITLE: Musical Pairs

* Progress

** Pomodoro 1 - Saturday PM

I bootstrapped with yeoman and beginning to work on the first part -
that is getting some squares to appear on the screen. I forgot a lot
of what I learnt about crafty last time so this feels slow
going. Maybe I will warm up.

Identified a few admin tasks like doing an 'im in' post and also
putting on a license. I don't feel like doing these just yet.


** Pomodoro 2 - Saturday PM

I managed to get to lay out 9 cards on a grid (which was great until I
remembered pairs is better usually with an even number).

I managed to get a basic wav sound playing but that was a bit crap.


** Unstructed noodling - Saturday Evening and Sunday Morning

Some idling around and non-structured time in the evening and this
morning. I now have a game that is relatively playable. That is, you
click something and it will play a sound and be selected.

When you click something with the same sound then it will pair these
two off. 

I want to spend some time tidying up the code as I feel it is going to
be hard to extend it the way it is. Namely:

- lots of weird if-branching in the "CardSelected" screen
- the delay was the only way to get states transitioning nicely 
- what is the role of a 'model' component right now?
- Using components for state transitions is a good thing?

Some other puzzles I have about the specifics of allowing soundfonts
in my game. I kinda hope that's OK. I figure it's the same thing as
using something like Ableton and built in midi right? Currently using
a basic piano sound, MIT licensed etc.

After I tidy up a bit, I want to work on a basic game flow... that is,
make the game winnable and restartable. Then there are some more ideas
but let's just focus on that for now.
